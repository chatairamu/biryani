# Future Improvements and Production-Ready Features

This document lists suggested features and improvements to make this e-commerce application more robust, user-friendly, and ready for a live production environment. Many foundational features have been built, and this list represents the next logical steps.

## 1. Core E-commerce Enhancements

- **Payment Gateway Integration:**
  - Integrate a real payment gateway like Stripe, Razorpay, or PayPal to handle secure online payments. This is the highest priority for a live store.

- **Advanced Search & Filtering:**
  - On the search and product listing pages, add advanced filtering options, such as filtering by price range, average rating, or specific tags.

- **Product-Level SEO:**
  - Add fields for SEO meta titles and descriptions to products, categories, and tags to improve search engine visibility.

- **Sale & Campaign Scheduling:**
  - Add start and end dates to coupon codes.
  - Create a system for scheduling sales (e.g., setting a future start/end date for a product's sale price).

## 2. User Experience and Account Features

- **Guest Checkout:**
  - Allow users to check out without creating an account, which can significantly increase conversion rates.

- **Social Logins:**
  - Allow users to sign up or log in using social media accounts like Google or Facebook.

- **Order Modification/Cancellation:**
  - Allow users to request a cancellation for an order that is still in the 'Pending' or 'Processing' state.

## 3. Admin and Store Management

- **Advanced Admin Dashboard Analytics:**
  - Implement visual charts (using a library like Chart.js) for the statistics on the admin dashboard to make trends easier to spot.

- **Review Management:**
  - Create a new section in the admin panel where admins can approve, edit, or delete user-submitted reviews before they appear on the site.

- **Configurable Settings:**
  - Move hardcoded values, such as the low-stock alert threshold (currently 10), into the "Store Settings" page to make them easily configurable by the admin.

- **Pagination:**
  - Add pagination to all tables in the admin dashboard (Products, Orders, Users) and to the main user-facing product list to improve performance and usability as the store grows.

## 4. Technical and Architectural Improvements

- **Email Sending Integration:**
  - Complete the "Forgot Password" feature by integrating a real email sending service (e.g., PHPMailer with an SMTP provider like SendGrid or Mailgun).
  - Use this service to send automated order confirmation and status update emails to customers.

- **Environment-specific Configuration:**
  - Move sensitive credentials (like database passwords and API keys) out of the main `config.php` file and into a `.env` file that is not committed to version control. This is a critical security best practice.

- **CSRF Protection:**
  - Implement Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) tokens on all forms to prevent malicious attacks.

- **API-driven Frontend:**
  - For a more modern and scalable application, refactor the backend to function as a RESTful API. The frontend could then be rebuilt using a JavaScript framework (like Vue.js or React) that consumes this API. This provides a clear separation of concerns and a better user experience.
