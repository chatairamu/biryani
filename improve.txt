# Future Improvements and Production-Ready Features

This document lists suggested features and improvements to make this e-commerce application more robust, user-friendly, and ready for a live production environment.

## 1. Core E-commerce Features

- **Payment Gateway Integration:**
  - Integrate a real payment gateway like Stripe, Razorpay, or PayPal to handle online payments securely instead of just "Cash on Delivery".

- **User Reviews and Ratings:**
  - Allow logged-in users who have purchased a product to leave a star rating and a written review.
  - Display average ratings on product pages and sort products by rating.

- **Search Functionality:**
  - Implement a proper search feature (`search.php`) that queries the database for products based on name and description.

- **Related Products:**
  - On a product detail page, show a section for "You might also like" featuring related products (e.g., based on category or purchase history).

## 2. User Account and Experience

- **Password Reset:**
  - Implement a "Forgot Password" feature that allows users to reset their password securely via an email link.

- **Order Tracking:**
  - Expand the order status system (e.g., 'Processing', 'Shipped', 'Delivered', 'Cancelled').
  - Allow users to view a detailed history and track the status of their orders.

- **Wishlist / Favorites:**
  - Allow users to save products to a wishlist for future purchase.

## 3. Admin and Store Management

- **Advanced Inventory Management:**
  - Add low-stock alerts for admins.
  - Prevent checkout if an item's stock runs out while it's in the user's cart (currently only checked at the moment of order processing).

- **Automated Email Notifications:**
  - Send automated emails to customers for events like:
    - Account registration confirmation.
    - Order confirmation.
    - Shipping and delivery updates.
  - This would require setting up an email sending service (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun) or using a local mail server.

- **Advanced Admin Dashboard Analytics:**
  - Add charts and stats to the admin dashboard showing sales trends, top-selling products, and new user registrations over time.

- **Product Categories:**
  - Implement a full category management system so products can be organized and filtered by category.

## 4. Technical and Security Enhancements

- **Environment-specific Configuration:**
  - Separate development and production configurations (e.g., using a `.env` file) to keep sensitive credentials out of version control.

- **CSRF Protection:**
  - Add Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) tokens to all forms to enhance security.

- **API for Frontend:**
  - For a more modern and scalable approach, refactor the backend to be a RESTful API that the frontend can consume via JavaScript. This decouples the frontend and backend.

- **Comprehensive Logging:**
  - Implement a robust logging system (e.g., using Monolog) to log errors, user actions, and important system events for easier debugging and auditing.
